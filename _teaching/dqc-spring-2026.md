## Course Description
This seminar course explores the emerging field of distributed quantum computing, where information is processed and shared across interconnected quantum systems. The course will cover three broad areas: quantum networks and their applications; distributing quantum programs, and hybrid quantum-classical computing. We will work together to develop a deep understanding of this content through just-in-time lectures on foundational topics, class presentations and discussions of research papers; and student-led tutorials. Students will also create a research or survey project of their choosing.
