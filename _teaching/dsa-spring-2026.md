## Course Description
This course explores the principles of distributed systems, 
emphasizing fundamental issues underlying the design of such systems: 
communication, coordination, synchronization, and fault-tolerance. 
We will study key algorithms and theoretical results
and explore how these foundations play out in modern systems and applications 
like cloud computing, edge computing, and peer-to-peer systems.
