## Course Description
This course covers the formal foundations of computability and complexity. 
We aim to answer fundamental questions about what problems can be solved and what problems cannot be solved, 
and what problems can be solved given our limited resources. 
Topics include: the Church-Turing thesis; variations of Turing Machines; decidability; the Halting Problem; 
reducibility; the Recursion Theorem; time and space complexity; intractability; NP-completeness; 
and Cookâ€™s theorem. We will also discuss some unconventional computing models, 
such as optical computing and DNA computing.
