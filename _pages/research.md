## Current Projects
* **Efficient, Private, and Explainable Federated Learning for Financial Crime Detection** : We are developing resource-efficient 
privacy-preserving federated methods for learning and explainiability, with the primary application financial crime detection. 
* **NSF CAREER: Toward A Machine Learning Framework for the Internet of Things** : This goal of this project is to
   develop a new paradigm and tools for machine learning over the massive-scale, geographically distributed data in the Internet of Things.
* **NSF CSR: Small: Virtual Sky: Morphable Geo-Spatial Computing for the Internet of Planes** : In this project, we are developing distributed methods 
for situational awareness and coordination in future aerospace systems.


## Past Projects
* **Secure and Robust Cross-Silo Vertical Federated Learning** : In this project, we developed new Vertical Federated Learning methods 
that operate over datasets with missing labels and features. This project was funded by the Rensselaer-IBM Artificial Intelligence Research Collaboration (2021 - 2022).
* **Towards a General Framework for Robust Vertical Federated Learning** : This project focused on Vertical Federated Learning, specifically the creation and 
analysis of methods that are communication efficient and robust to heterogeneous participants. 
This project was funded by the Rensselaer-IBM Artificial Intelligence Research Collaboration (2020 - 2021).
* **Predictive Resource Configuration and Scheduling for Cost-Efficient Data Processing in AWS** (PSEG, 2019)
* **Interactive Visualization of Communications in Networked Programs to Enhance Student Learning and Aid Debugging** (RPI Teaching and Learning Seed Proposal Award, 2019)
* **NSF CSR: III: Small:  Collaborative Research:  A Hybrid Vehicle-Cloud Solution for Robust, Cost-Efficient Road Monitoring** (2015-2019)
* **Robust Autonomous Underwater Grasping with the Parallel-Jaw Gripper** (2015)
